# Table-Tennis-Equipment

**Project Description:**
Table Tennis is a game played inside by two or four people. It requires only two
player paddles, lightweight balls, and a normal table to play its fast-paced rallies. The
code I have below as a requirement for OOPs final project demonstrates an ObjectOriented approach in representing table tennis equipment. It utilizes inheritance and
abstraction to create a hierarchy of classes that model different equipment items and
their properties. It also touches upon another core OOP concept the Encapsulation
and Polymorphism.

**Importance and Contribution of the Project:**
This project's importance lies in two key areas. First, it showcases the main object-oriented
programming (OOP) principles: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
These principles contribute to well-structured and maintainable code. Second, this project
serves as a foundation for creating a larger OOP project related to table tennis. You can
expand on it by adding new equipment classes and functionalities, such as implementing
cost calculation, stock management, or game simulation.
Anyone interested in understanding table tennis equipment can benefit from this code. The
code serves as a basic reference for how Table Tennis equipment can be categorized and
represented using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. It clearly separates
common attributes (brand, name) from specific details (grip style, material). This
separation makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
